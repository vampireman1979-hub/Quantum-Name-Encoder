# Quantum-Name-Encoder
The Quantum Name Encoder is a deterministic, symbol‑free method for embedding text identifiers into quantum circuits. It converts names into fixed‑length ASCII vectors, maps them to rotation angles, and encodes each on a dedicated qubit with a simple entanglement structure for reproducible quantum‑ML features.
